# Data Extraction from PDFs using Python

## Introduction

This project involved extracting data from multiple PDF files and converting them to CSV files for easier use and manipulation. Using a combination of these 3 custom algorithms, data was extracted from 11 different PDF files.

The PDF files contained information on students from 11 different schools. To ensure their privacy is protected, all file names have been replaced with generic placeholders and any visible information in the screenshots of the PDFs (provided for context) has been blacked out.
